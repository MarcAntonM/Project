      <h1>History of the Wind Turbine</h1><br>

      <h3>We have been using wind energy for thousands of years</h3><br>
          <p>Wind engergy can be traced back to ancient civilisations that harnessed its power for sailboats and early windmills. These innovations show humanity's initial understanding of capturing wind energy.</p>
      
       <h2 id="wtYear">1888</h2>
        <h3>Charles Brush pioneering the turbine</h3>
          <p>The mordern erea of wind turbines began in the late 19th century when Charles F. Brush contructed the worlds first large-scale wind turbine in the United States in 1888. With a rotor diameter of 17 metres, it lit up his mansion using eletrcity generated from wind power, marking a significant leap in harnessing wind for electricity.</p>

      <h2 id="wtYear">1941</h2>
        <h3>Smith-Putnam: The Megawatt Milestone</h3>
          <p>In 1941, the Smith-Putnam wind turbine in Vermont, United States became the first megawatt scale wind turbine, representing a breakthrough in scaling up wind power for lager energy needs. This marked a pivotal moment in the evolution of wind turbine technology and set the stage for future advancements.</p>

      <h2>1970</h2>
        <h3>The Oil Crisis and Denmark's Leadership.</h3>
          <p>The oil crisis of the 1970s prompted a interest in alternative energy, with Denmark emerging as a leader in wind energy. Innovative policies and incentives laid the foundation for the widespread adoption of wind turbines, marking a turning point in the industry's growth.</p>

      <h2>1980</h2>
        <h3>The Rise of the Three-Bladed Turbine</h3>
          <p>In the 1980s, there was commercialization of wind energy on a global scale. The "Danish Concept" that featured a sleep three bladed turbines, became the standard design. Technological advancements, including the use of composite materials, improved efficiency and reliability, propelling wind energy into the main stream.</p>

        <h3>Global Expansion and Commercial Growth</h3>
          <p>Governments worldwide began to support wind energy projects through subsidies and incentives in the 1980s, fostering commerical growth. This era marked a significant shift, with wind turbines becoming a vital contributor to the global energy landscape.</p>

      <h2>2000</h2>
        <h3>21st Century Technological Advancements</h3>
          <p>In the 21st century, we seen substantial growth in wind power capacity globally. Ongoing research and development led to larger and more efficient turbines. Advancements in technology improved materials and control systemsn and continued to refine wind turbine technology</p>

      <h2>The Future</h2>
        <h3>Offshore Wind Farms and the Future</h3>
          <p>Today, wind turbines play a crucial role in the renewable energy landscape, with offshore wind farms emerging as significant contributor which are used to harness the energy from the sea winds. Ongoing innovation aims to enhance efficiency, reduce costs and secure wind power's place as a clean and sustainable energy source for the future.</p>














      <p>is a device that converts the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical energy which is used to generate electricity. It is a renewable source of energy. They have many key components such as</p><br>

      <h2>Key compononents to Wind Turbine</h2><br>
      <p>Rotor Blades - This is a large blade attached to a rotor, this is used to capture the energy from the wind </p><br>
      <p>Nacelle - The rotor is conneceted to a nacelle, which houses the components used for conversion of wind to electrical engergy. This includes generator, gearbox and other electronics.</p><br>
      <p>Generator - The mechanical energy captured by the rotor is then transferred to a generator where it is converted to electrical energy.</p><br>
      <p>Tower - The entire structure is mounted on a tall tower allowing the turbine to capture stronger wind speeds at a higher altitude.</p> <br>
      <p>Control System - Modern wind turbines are equipped with </p>
